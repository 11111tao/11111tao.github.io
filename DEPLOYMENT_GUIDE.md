# 📚 Tag Feature Deployment Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🏷️ Tag System Features
1. **Upload with Tags**: When uploading files, you can now add custom tags (philosophy, exercise, body-building, etc.)
2. **Tag Display**: Tags appear as clickable chips above the "阅读更多" button on each card
3. **Tag Filtering**: Click any tag to filter and show only content with that tag
4. **Tag Filter UI**: Each tab (博客/笔记) has a filter section showing all available tags
5. **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Works entirely with localStorage, no backend required

### 🎨 UI Components Added
- Upload modals with tag input
- Tag input field with "Add" button
- Removable tag chips
- Tag filter section

# 3. When ready to deploy:

```
